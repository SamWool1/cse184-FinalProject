# cse184-FinalProject

Before running anything in our .ipynb related to scraping, please run `pip install pypatent`, or an equivalent command, in order to install the `pypatent` library. This library is vital to our functions related to scraping. HOWEVER, a dataset has already been generated by our scraping, and it is not necessary to run any of our functions related to webscraping again. Therefore, it is only necessary to install `pypatent` if you plan to run our web-scraping related functions.
